                Brain Health affects us all in different ways. 
                Stories have existed long before websites and are another way of learning and connecting.
              </strong>
              <br><br>
              Denise and Bernard Coley’s journey with Parkinson’s disease is one of shared strength, 
              adaptation, and advocacy. Denise began learning about her symptoms and speaking openly 
              about her experience, while Bernard became her care partner and strongest advocate. 
              By exploring other people's brain health journeys, we can learn more about ourselves. 
              So, feel free to explore real community anecdotes as you navigate the Community Resource tabs!
