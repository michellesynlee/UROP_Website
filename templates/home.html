          <strong>Denise and Bernard Coley’s journey with Parkinson’s disease is one of shared strength, adaptation, and advocacy.</strong>
          <br><br>
          In time, their story became one of partnership and purpose. Denise began learning about her symptoms and speaking openly about her experience, 
          while Bernard became her care partner and strongest advocate.
          Together, they engage in outreach within Black communities, participate in Parkinson’s research, 
          and support others navigating the same challenges.
